### Overview

The eSRS API is a REST service of interacting with the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System to submit and view subcontracting reports provided by the vendors which are required to do so by *FAR CASES*.

This is the skeleton documentation which describes that REST service and how to use it.

##### Get started
We organized this site into four major areas.

- [API basics](basics.html) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API calls](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations with an interactive console.
- [Field reference](fields.html) lists and describes the type of information provided by the API.
- [Feedback](https://github.com/GSA/GSA-APIs/issues) provides a forum for developers to share feedback and report problems.
